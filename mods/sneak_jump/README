Minetest Sneak Jump Mod

Allows to sneak jump while player is holding the Use key (default [E]) only.
Adds (optional) stamina.  Stamina drain and fill rates are configurable, as well
as sprinting speed, jump height, and gravity.  Check settingtypes.txt for the
configuration parameters, or look in the Advanced Settings tab in Minetest.

When not sprinting, `new_move` is on and `sneak_glitch` is disabled.  Sprinting
inverts these two physics overrides, allowing sneak jumping using the old move
code.
