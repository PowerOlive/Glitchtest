-- `books' mod for Minetest game `Glitchtest'
-- Copyright 2018 James Alexander Stevenson
-- GNU GPL 3

-- A node that stores various written things, in particular books.
-- A "book reader" node, that shows an interface to its contents,
-- paginated, with tabs, for easy reading among multiple books.

-- I may incorporate Glitchtest specific books into this mod, for
-- distribution with the game.  A sort of "in-game help system."

-- Ideally these books would be generated from a flat text file.
-- Then, perhaps, the "?" `help' dialogs could also pull from there.

-- I'd also like to rehash my old `books' mod, "Placeable Books."
-- Then, I would move jas0/paper.lua as well as default:*book*,
-- which includes the shelf.
