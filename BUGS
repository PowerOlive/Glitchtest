I fixed multiskin erroring on "default:dirt" texture.  Now, it appears that when
	joining the game as a node class, that when wielding a walkie after
	changing back to miner results in the compass being shown behind the hearts!
	[This should be okay, now.  I just reorganized the order of hud flags
	being set, seemed to work.]

Sometimes switching to/from node class results in bugs.  Like getting an item in your
	hand from prior class.  Or the hotbar on the hud showing visual glitches
	(vertical lines).  There's also the matter of multiskin attempting to set
	player's skin to "default:dirt" and the like.

Explosions seem to erase backpacks, other stuff.  I did function() end on on_blast
	for backpack, hopefully that helps.  Still need to explode the contents.

I was underground battling with Oerkki and NPCs, when I saw the minimap come on when I hit
	the button.  But, I didn't have a walkie!  What?  [Got it, forgot to turn it off
	if wielded ~= walkie... -jas]

Sometimes the player's HP (built-in statbar, not override (breath is hidden/off)) does not
	display on the HUD.  The reason, I suspect, is because I had a level 99 miner
	and 1/99 HP shows as zero (out of twenty) on the HUD.  I wonder if I can override
	it easily, I don't want to redo the HP statbar, but I might eventually.  [Update:
	Armor suffers the same issue, if a very low value, shows as `0' on statbar!]

When the player's `wielditem' (mod), in third person, item is constantly set, models resets.
	Example: Holding a walkie talkie, which is always setting(?).  Or updating something,
	causing the model to reset (not fully animate, go back to frame 0 repeatedly)...

The last item on the list of teleports in the bed formspec, if deleted, doesn't
	update the index.  So what happens is that once you delete the last
	item, it won't work again until you select a new item.
